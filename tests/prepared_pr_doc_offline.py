"""Prove the drift-doc generator cannot silently drop a key artifact.

A hand-written resume list went stale and omitted the branch that is one of this repo's two adoption
artifacts (corrective action 2026-09-16 16:34 UTC).  The generator now fails loudly instead.  This
script checks that with deliberate mutations - a law that cannot fail is a weak law, so each guard is
shown failing on input built to trip it, and passing on the real input.

Run:  python3 tests/prepared_pr_doc_offline.py     (exit 0 = all checks pass, no network)
